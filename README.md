# [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/) Community

Welcome to the CAP Community. This place is intended to support a structured communication with SAP. The canonical short link to this CAP Community home is [bit.ly/cap-com](https://bit.ly/cap-com) - please use this link when sharing directions to this place.

If you're using CAP and have an option to file tickets using the [SAP Service Marketplace](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/), you can do so using these components:

* BC-XS-CDX - SAP Cloud application programming model
* BC-XS-CDX-COR - SAP CAP – Compiler and CDS language
* BC-XS-CDX-JAV - SAP CAP – Java runtime
* BC-XS-CDX-NJS - SAP CAP – Node.js runtime
* BC-XS-CDX-TLS - SAP CAP – tools, IDEs, build, deployment

If you don't have that option, you can use the [Issues](https://github.com/sapmentors/cap-community/issues) in this repository (please check to see that you're not creating a duplicate first). 

Please [post pure questions](https://answers.sap.com/questions/ask.html?primaryTagId=9f13aee1-834c-4105-8e43-ee442775e5ce), appropriately tagged (this link will do that for you), in the SAP Community Q&A.

For interactive discussions register for the [SAP Mentors and Friends Slack Workspace](https://sapmentors-slack-invite.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/) and join the [#CAP](https://sapmentors.slack.com/messages/CNX247875) channel.
